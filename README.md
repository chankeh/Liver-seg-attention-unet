* Automatic segmentation of the liver is an important step towards deriving quantitative biomarkers for accurate clinical diagnosis and
computer-aided decision support systems.
* Used the 2D U-Net architecture integrating attention mechanism and dice loss for accurate liver segmentation.
* Understood and processed the image data using Numpy and Scikit-Image. Implemented Attention-UNet using PyTorch.
* Achieved Dice scores over 96% for the liver in LiTS challenge dataset with computation times below 100s per volume. Applied the
technology to Nanjing Zhongda Hospital to help doctors in clinical research.
